# Android Test

Android demo app, which shows a list of post with its detail from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

I attached the APK in the root of the project if you want to check the application running ðŸ¤“ðŸ“²

## Libraries



```bash
- [Dagger2](https://github.com/google/dagger)
- [RxJava and RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
- [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
- [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson)
- [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp)
```



## Architecture
I used the [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/), injection of dependencies with dagger2. No matter the size of a project, for it to be sustainable, an architecture must be applied, based on it, I applied the principles of MVI (Model View Intent), to obtain a low cohesion between modules and easy maintenance
